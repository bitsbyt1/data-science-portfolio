Python
Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE





### Future modifications: ###

Use Python Flask to make a working http/css web page which will be able to classify the images.
