### Task ###
Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements only.

### Problem ###
Typically, the age of an abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope. This process is tedious and time-consuming.

### Solution ###
Create a machine learning algorithm that will predict the age of an abalone from physical measurements only.

### Dataset information ###
8 attributes
4177 instances
Sex: nominal - M (male), F (female), I (infant)

`Length`: continuous - longest shell measurement (in mm)

`Diameter`: continuous - measurement perpendicular to legnth (in mm)

`Height`: continuous - with meat in shell (in mm)

`Whole weight`: continuous - the whole abalone (in grams)

`Shucked weight`: continuous - weight of the meat (in grams)

`Viscera weight`: continuous - gut weight after bleeding (in grams)

`Shell weight`: continuous - after being dried (in grams)

`Rings`: integer - +1.5 gives the age in years
