### Bangalore Real Estate Price Prediction ###



I built a model using sklearn and linear regression using the banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. 

Then I made a python flask server that used the saved model to serve http requests. 

Lastly I build a simple website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter features like square ft area, bedrooms, etc. and then use flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 

In this project I used the following techniques:
> * Data loading
> 
> * Data cleaning
> 
> * Outlier detection and removal
> 
> * Feature engineering
> 
> * Dimensionality reduction
>
> * Gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning
>
> * k-fold Cross-Validation


The technology and tools used were:
> * Python
> 
> * Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
> 
> * Matplotlib for data visualization
> 
> * Sklearn for model building
> 
> * Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
> 
> * Python flask for http server
> 
> * HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
